# Dice-Rolling-Game
Dice Rolling Game- Any number/size of Dice w/ Doubles feature

Input the Number of dice, and the number of sides on each die.

Press "Roll Dice"

The program will give you the value for each dice rolled..  It will also tell you if you have rolled any doubles, how many doubles, and what those doubles were.

The Program is built with a 'reset button' so one can execute the program as many times as they wish without refreshing the page.

Eventually I will improve the 'doubles' function to also list 'triples' 'quadruples' 'etc'.

I coded this program for practice.

The CSS is basic 'Normalized' CSS, no fancy styles added.

ENJOY!
